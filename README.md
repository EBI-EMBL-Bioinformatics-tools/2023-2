# EBI-EMBL Bioinformatics-tools 2023-2 

EBI-EMBL is an advanced undergraduate and postgraduate level class taught at the Universidad de los Andes in association with EBI-EMBL, the sessions are taught by both institutions face-to-face and virtual. The course aims to provide the student with the necessary tools to access the main databases of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), to promote in students the use of this information to generate discoveries. In addition, the student must create and develop a research project using the tools learned.
